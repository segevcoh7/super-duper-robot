# Analysis of New York Airbnb Dataset

## üìò Project Overview

This project analyzes the Airbnb dataset for New York City to understand factors affecting pricing, identify trends across neighborhoods, and find the most cost-effective accommodations. Using statistical and geospatial methods, this project provides actionable insights for Airbnb hosts, travelers, and policymakers.

## üîç Key Objectives

1. **Pricing by Neighborhood**: Understand average pricing trends in neighborhoods, focusing on Manhattan.
2. **Distribution Analysis**: Compare price distributions of specific neighborhoods to overall NYC distribution.
3. **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**: Identify the top 1,000 cost-effective listings in NYC using custom scoring.
4. **Statistical Confidence**: Use bootstrap methods to estimate average prices with confidence intervals.
5. **Variable Correlations**: Examine the relationship between price and other factors, such as reviews and availability.

## üìä Methods and Approach

### **Data Source**
- The dataset: [`Airbnb_Open_Data.csv`](Airbnb_Open_Data.csv)
- Geospatial data: [`NY.geojson`](NY.geojson)

### **Steps in Analysis**
1. Data Cleaning:
   - Converted pricing and service fee columns to numeric.
   - Filtered outliers and irrelevant listings.
   - Focused on homes with sufficient reviews (‚â•10).

2. Geospatial Analysis:
   - Used [`NY.geojson`](NY.geojson) with `leaflet` in R to visualize neighborhood-level price trends.
   - Created an interactive heatmap showing average prices by neighborhood.

3. Statistical Insights:
   - Bootstrapped average price estimates with 95% confidence intervals.
   - Analyzed linear correlations between price and variables like number of reviews and availability.

4. Cost-Effectiveness Scoring:
   - Designed a custom scoring algorithm based on price, reviews, and features like cancellation policy and host verification.

## üìà Visualizations and Findings

### **Heatmap of Pricing by Neighborhood**
- A heatmap was created using `leaflet` in R to display average prices across NYC neighborhoods.
- **Key finding**: Central NYC neighborhoods had similar pricing trends, likely due to high competition and demand.

### **Distribution Comparison**
- Neighborhood-specific price distributions were compared to overall NYC distribution.
- **Key insight**: Price distributions varied significantly, except for Midtown, which closely matched NYC's overall pattern.

### **Cost-Effective Listings**
- Identified the top 1,000 cost-effective listings using a scoring algorithm.
- **Observation**: Listings with high scores often shared attributes like flexible cancellation policies and verified hosts.

### **Bootstrap Analysis**
- Estimated the average price across NYC listings with a 95% confidence interval.
- **Result**: Average price ~524.27 (¬±1.94 standard error).

### **Variable Correlation**
- Analyzed the linear correlation between price and variables like reviews, availability, and rating.
- **Finding**: Correlations were weak, indicating complex pricing dynamics.
